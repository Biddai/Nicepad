# Nicepad
The Nicepad is a remix of the Printedpad, which is a macropad that specializes in layering. There are 2 versions - a regular 6-keys and an XL with 9 keys.

# BOM
To make the macropad you need:
7\10 MX-style switches
Raspberry Pi Zero
Mono OLED 0.96 inch
Wires and soldering equipment (I recommend 1mm bare copper wires and 30awg wires)
M2 Heatset inserts
M2 socket head screw

# Printing
The nicepad is made to be easily printed with any Bambulab printers (makerworld link). Make sure to use supports only on the bed!

I recommend these (link to keycaps) as they are cute. any other mx style keycap should work.

# Assembly

We first want to check that everything fits - try to place the OLED in the slot in the frame, try to close the bottom and top of the frame and make sure they click, and try to insert switches into the plate and make sure they click in.

## The switches
Place the switches in the plate, making sure to use the correct size (the inserts for the screws should be the top).
Then, wire the switches. I opted for direct wiring, as they are simpler than a matrix and I figured that a matrix will result in more work overall.
